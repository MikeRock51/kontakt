A simple contact directory built with React, NodeJS and MongoDB

## Task
The exercise involves developing a simple contact directory using React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage.

Key features of this application include:

1. Users should be able to add contacts, complete with their photo.
2. Each time a contact is viewed, the view count should be stored in the database.

## Installation
- Install backend dependencies
  - Navigate into the backend directory and run "npm install" (You need to have NodeJS and Redis installed on your machine)
  - Replace the connection string in storage/db.js with the connection string to your mongo database.
  - Start backend server (make sure redis is running): "npm run dev"
  - The API will be running on port 5000
- Install the frontend dependencies: Navigate to the frontend directory and run "npm install"
  - Navigate into the backend directory and run "npm install"
  - The app will now be running on port 3000
